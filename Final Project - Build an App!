# 📱 Phone Time Tracker App

This is a simple Python app built with `tkinter` that allows users to manually track how many minutes they've used their phone in a day. The goal is to help users become more aware of their screen time and develop better phone usage habits.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The purpose of this app is to give users a lightweight tool for tracking phone usage manually. Users enter the number of minutes they’ve used their phone, and the app keeps a running total for the day. There is also a reset button to start fresh at any time.

---

## 🛠 Features

- ✅ Add minutes of phone use to a daily total  
- ✅ Display the total usage in real time  
- ✅ Reset button to clear the total  
- ❌ (Planned) Save daily usage to a file  
- ❌ (Planned) Weekly usage tracking and graphing  
- ❌ (Planned) Web or mobile version

## 🧩 How It Works

The app uses Python’s built-in `tkinter` module to create a basic GUI:
- An input field allows users to type in how many minutes they’ve used their phone.
- When the "Add Time" button is clicked, the app updates and displays the new total.
- A "Reset" button clears the total back to zero.

## 🧪 What I Learned

Through building this app, I learned how to:
- Create a GUI using `tkinter`
- Connect user inputs to custom functions
- Manage variables and real-time updates inside an app

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add a save feature to store daily usage in a file (like `.csv`)
- Display usage over a week in a simple chart
- Rebuild the app for the web using PyScript or Shiny for Python
- Eventually turn this into a mobile app using Kivy

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Save the code as `phone_tracker.py`.
3. Run it using:

```bash
python phone_tracker.py

import tkinter as tk

# Initialize total usage
total_minutes = 0

# Function to add usage time
def add_minutes():
    global total_minutes
    try:
        minutes = int(entry.get())
        total_minutes += minutes
        result_label.config(text=f"Total usage today: {total_minutes} minutes")
        entry.delete(0, tk.END)
    except ValueError:
        result_label.config(text="Please enter a valid number.")

# Function to reset usage
def reset_usage():
    global total_minutes
    total_minutes = 0
    result_label.config(text="Total usage today: 0 minutes")

# Create window
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Phone Time Tracker")
root.geometry("300x200")

# Widgets
label = tk.Label(root, text="Enter phone use in minutes:")
label.pack(pady=5)

entry = tk.Entry(root)
entry.pack(pady=5)

add_button = tk.Button(root, text="Add Time", command=add_minutes)
add_button.pack(pady=5)

reset_button = tk.Button(root, text="Reset", command=reset_usage)
reset_button.pack(pady=5)

result_label = tk.Label(root, text="Total usage today: 0 minutes")
result_label.pack(pady=10)

# Run app
root.mainloop()
